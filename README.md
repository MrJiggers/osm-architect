# OSM Architect
  
Application for 3D visualization of map data from OpenStreetMap.

User can export map data from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) website and then put the file into ./Map folder. Application can render the map data into 3D scene. Rendered data can be removed by clicking on the roof of the building. User can also put own 3D models into 3D scene. Models must be exported into AssetBundle format and putted into ./3DObjects folder.
